      <description>Introduction Hello, and welcome to my blog! I wanted to share with you a mini-project that&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for some time.
You see, I have a huge collection of MIDI files from various bands that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to learn guitar (actually, they&amp;rsquo;re Guitar Pro files, but converting them to MIDI is easy enough). With such musical data, I knew there was potential for an interesting machine learning project. There are countless things to explore, such as genre classification or instrument recognition, but I decided to focus on music generation.</description>
