      <description>Notebook: here
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share a fun mini project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on üéâ. I came across a dataset of tweets with emojis on Kaggle and thought, &amp;ldquo;Why not try to do something with this?&amp;rdquo; ü§î. The project started out pretty standard, but as there was a ton of data and my architectures were quite large (I tried transformers again without success - yet again üòÖ), it quickly became challenging.</description>

      <description>Introduction This time around, I felt the urge to explore the world of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders). These autoencoders can be used for generating new data, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get into that in a bit. I wanted to avoid the all-too-common MNIST example, so I opted for a more adventurous route: generating ‚≠êart!‚≠ê This experiment could either be a smashing success or an entertaining disaster. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into this artistic adventure with VAEs&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello, and welcome to my blog! I wanted to share with you a mini-project that&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind for some time.
You see, I have a huge collection of MIDI files from various bands that I&amp;rsquo;ve used to learn guitar (actually, they&amp;rsquo;re Guitar Pro files, but converting them to MIDI is easy enough). With such musical data, I knew there was potential for an interesting machine learning project. There are countless things to explore, such as genre classification or instrument recognition, but I decided to focus on music generation.</description>
